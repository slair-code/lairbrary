    <h2>About This Space</h2>
    <p>
      A cozy corner of the web for book lovers who crave the spark that makes reading feel like coming home. Nestled between stories and stillness, The Lairbrary is a place for the reader who’s lost their way. If you’ve ever stared at a shelf, a screen, or a stack and thought: “None of these feel right”—that’s where I come in. I’ve made it my calling to help readers find the right book at the right time. With years of academic training, literary obsession, and school librarian magic, I can guide you to titles you didn’t even know you were craving. Take a short journey through a reading questionnaire and unlock a collection for you.

    <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      I believe books are shelter. They teach, transform, and give us a place to belong. After years of studying literature and nurturing young readers in schools, I’ve built The Lairbrary as a reading refuge. You answer a short, meaningful questionnaire—and I recommend books chosen with intention and care. Whether you’re burned out, curious, grieving, or hungry for something new—this is where your next chapter begins.
